# Developer-Portfolio
In this project i aimed to create a showc ase of my work throughout the process of learning to be a full stack developer.

during this project I built onto the previous html knowledge and added css styling to create a webpage with varying colors for fonts, box models, and the webpage itself, while this was a challenge in every sense of the word, I look forward to further developing my skills as my training continues.
